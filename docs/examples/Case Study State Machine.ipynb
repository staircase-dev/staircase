    "\n",
    "This case study illustrates the use of the staircase package for analysing data derived from a [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram). States are either active or not active, and transitions between states are triggered by events.  It is these events (and the time at which they occur) which comprise the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used is this case study is synthetic and fictional.  Both data and the notebook for this tutorial can be obtained from the [github site](https://github.com/venaturum/staircase/tree/master/docs/examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "The state machine diagram is pictured below.  Note that state A is the initial state (at time = 0).  Note that the transitions between states A and B, and the transitions between C and D, share the same labels.  This complicates the analysis, however we can still derive the results with some step function arithmetic! \n",

In fact we start in state A, and finish in state C, and so there aren't even an equal number of *p* and *q* events in our data (see value_counts result below).
