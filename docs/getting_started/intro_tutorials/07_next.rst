What next?
==========

With the basics covered you can now turn your attention to more advanced operations including :ref:`masking <user_guide.masking>`, :ref:`slicing <user_guide.slicing>` and analysing the :ref:`distribution of values <user_guide.distributions>`.  These topics and more are covered in the :ref:`User Guide <user_guide>` where you can also find a :ref:`FAQ <user_guide.faq>` and :ref:`cookbook <user_guide.cookbook>`.  The :ref:`Case Studies <case_studies>` are a natural extension of the user guide, and walk readers through various applications of :mod:`staircase` to different use cases.

Don't forget to checkout the :ref:`cookbook <user_guide.gotchas>` to make sure staircase works the way you expect!

Need some step function data?  The :func:`staircase.make_test_data` function will get you what you need to start playing.
